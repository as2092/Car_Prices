# Predicting Car Prices using KNN
In this course, we explored the fundamentals of machine learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 
This project is to practice the machine learning workflow to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars.
For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
